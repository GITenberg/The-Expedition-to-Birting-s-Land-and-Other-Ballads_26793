5</span>THE EXPEDITION TO BIRTING&rsquo;S LAND</h2>
<p>The King he o&rsquo;er the castle rules,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He rules o&rsquo;er all the land;<br />
O&rsquo;er many a hardy hero too,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With naked sword in hand.</p>
<p>Let the courtier govern his steed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The boor his thatch&egrave;d cot,<br />
But Denmark&rsquo;s King o&rsquo;er castles rules,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For nobler is his lot.</p>
<p>King Diderik sits on Brattingsborg,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And round he looks with pride:<br />
&ldquo;No one I know of in the world<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would me in fight abide.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Then answered Brand Sir Viferlin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had been in many a land:<br />
&ldquo;Methinks I know a warrior stout<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would thee in fight withstand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Ifald call&rsquo;d, a king is he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Birting&rsquo;s land afar;<br />
And he has fellows following him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With savage wolves who war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O he has fellows following him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Gainst teeth of bears who fight;<br />
The food in which he most delights<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is flesh of Christian wight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every day in the East that dawns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His mouth he&rsquo;s wont to cool<br />
With serpents, toads, and other filth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That come from the hellish pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Ifald sat on his throne that day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He thus was heard to cry:<br />
&ldquo;Let some one bid my little foot page<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To come to me instantly.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;Now list to me, thou little foot page,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On my errand thee I&rsquo;ll send<br />
Unto the King of Brattingsborg,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To whom I am no friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him that he must tribute pay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or for bloody war prepare;<br />
Forsooth if him in the field I meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I him will little spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered straight the little foot page<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a gallant answer he gave:<br />
&ldquo;My Lord thy message I&rsquo;ll carry forth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though they lay me in my grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In came he, the little foot page,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stood before the board:<br />
&ldquo;Now list to me, King Diderik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My master has sent you word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either tribute thou shalt pay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As thou didst last year agree,<br />
Or thou shalt meet us in the field,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bloodshed there shall be.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;I will not tribute pay, forsooth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I scorn to stoop so low;<br />
Nay, rather unto Birting&rsquo;s land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With sword unsheathed I go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answer&rsquo;d Vitting Helfredson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And loud he laughed with glee:<br />
&ldquo;If ye fare this year into Birting&rsquo;s land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I too of the troop shall be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last year wast thou in Birting&rsquo;s land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there didst lose thy steed;<br />
Thou hadst better stay in Brattingsborg<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than again seek Birting&rsquo;s mead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On me, if I stay in Brattingsborg,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be every malison;<br />
If I have no horse on which to ride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have legs on which to run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There rode out from Brattingsborg<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So many a knight renown&rsquo;d;<br />
The rocks were split &rsquo;neath the coursers&rsquo; feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And quaked the startled ground.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>There rode forth King Diderik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lion upon his shield;<br />
And there too glittered the golden crown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So far across the field.</p>
<p>There rode Vidrik Verlandson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hammer and tongs he bore;<br />
And there rode good King Esmer&rsquo;s sons,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All men of wondrous power.</p>
<p>There rode the rich Count Rodengard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A warrior stout and fine;<br />
And there rode King Sir Sigfred, who<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Displayed a monarch&rsquo;s sign.</p>
<p>Then followed Siward Snarenswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With many arrows white;<br />
And then came Brand Sir Viferlin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who never fled from fight.</p>
<p>And next rode Hero Hogen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked a rose so brave;<br />
And then rode Folker Spillemand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In his hand a naked glaive.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Then rode the bold young Ulf Van Yern,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A glorious horse upon;<br />
Behind him young Sir Humble rode,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then Sir Sigfredson.</p>
<p>And then rode Gunther and Gernot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With arrow on bended bow;<br />
And there rode Sonne Tolkerson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With courage upon his brow.</p>
<p>There rode the little Grimmer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In golden acton dight;<br />
And there rode Seyer the active,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who yields to none in might.</p>
<p>And then came master Hildebrand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As though to his courser fixt;<br />
The stalwart friar Alsing rode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ancient hero next.</p>
<p>There rode Orm the Ungarswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So bold of heart was he;<br />
So joyous were they every one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sure of victory.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Out galloped they all from Brattingsborg,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As fast as they could speed;<br />
But Vitting bold came running behind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because he had no steed.</p>
<p>It was hardy Angelfyr,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Grimselin he cried:<br />
&ldquo;O, he must on his bare legs run<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who has no horse to ride!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And still ran Vitting, and still ran he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till with wrath he nigh was wode;<br />
Then he struck a warrior from his horse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sat himself on, and rode.</p>
<p>It was Sir King Diderik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He back a glance did throw:<br />
&ldquo;O yonder I see the courtier ride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who on foot was wont to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here thou, Vitting Helfredson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art a warrior bold;<br />
Thou shalt hie forward to Birting&rsquo;s land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And demand the tribute gold.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;With thee shall Vidrik Verlandson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Diderik knight of Bern;<br />
Of all my troop they are best at blows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And most for battle yearn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They set themselves upon their steeds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And away they rode like wind;<br />
The knights they roared, and their steeds they gored,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For wroth were they in mind.</p>
<p>The watchman stood on the battlement<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From whence he far could see:<br />
&ldquo;Yonder I warriors three espy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who wrathful seem to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one is Vitting Helfredson<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who lost his steed last year;<br />
That a rugged guest he&rsquo;ll prove to us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We have full cause to fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second is Vidrik Verlandson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the tongs and hammer shew;<br />
The third is Diderik Van Bern,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All warriors good, I trow.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>They left their steeds in the castle yard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the castle strode they in;<br />
Then might each man by their faces see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A fray would soon begin.</p>
<p>Upon the porter they laid their hands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And him to pieces hew&rsquo;d;<br />
Then in they strode to the high, high hall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And before the King they stood.</p>
<p>Then up rose Ifald the King in rage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus the King did cry:<br />
&ldquo;O, whence are come the ill-starr&rsquo;d loons<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before my board I spy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered the skinker of the King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who skink&egrave;d wine and mead:<br />
&ldquo;Our sharp spears, if we ply them well,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will drive them out with speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Vitting Helfredson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the beard the skinker has ta&rsquo;en;<br />
He smote him a blow the ear below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which dashed out half his brain.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>He flung the dead corse on the board,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a merry jest had he:<br />
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll taste,&rdquo; said Vitting Helfredson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;This precious roast for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then forth stepped Diderik Van Bern,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, brandishing his glaive,<br />
He hewed upon King Ifald&rsquo;s head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And him to the navel clave.</p>
<p>And forth stepped Vidrik Verlandson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And round began to hew;<br />
Heads and arms were smitten off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As round and round he flew.</p>
<p>In came King Ifald&rsquo;s mother grey,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With an eldritch scream she came;<br />
I tell to ye in verity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There ensued a wondrous game.</p>
<p>Vitting struck her with his sword,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A very fearful stroke;<br />
But she kissed asunder the good sword,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into pieces three it broke.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>With a single kiss of the witch&rsquo;s mouth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was shivered the trusty sword;<br />
Vitting the hag by the weazand seized,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without a single word.</p>
<p>The beldame changed herself to a crane,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And flew to the clouds on high;<br />
But Vitting donned a feather robe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pursued her through the sky.</p>
<p>They flew for a day, they flew for three,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bold Vitting and the crane;<br />
Then Vitting seized the crane by the legs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And her body rent in twain.</p>
<p>Homeward now, with sword in hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The valiant comrades wended:<br />
All the Birting kemps are dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the adventure ended.</p>

16</span>THE SINGING MARINER<br />
<i>A Ballad from the Spanish</i></h2>
<p>Who will ever have again,<br />
On the land or on the main,<br />
Such a chance as happen&rsquo;d to<br />
Count Arnaldos long ago.</p>
<p>With his falcon in his hand,<br />
Forth he went along the strand;<br />
There he saw a galley gay,<br />
Briskly bearing for the bay.</p>
<p>Ask me not her name and trade,&mdash;<br />
All the sails of silk were made;<br />
He who steer&rsquo;d the ship along<br />
Raised his voice, and sang a song.</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Sang a song whose magic force<br />
Calm&rsquo;d the breaker in its course;<br />
While the fishes, sore amazed,<br />
Left their holes and upward gazed.</p>
<p>And the fowl came flocking fast,<br />
Round the summit of the mast;<br />
Still he sang to wind and wave:<br />
&ldquo;God preserve my vessel brave!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guard her from the rocks that grow<br />
&rsquo;Mid the sullen deep below;<br />
From the gust, and from the breeze,<br />
Sweeping through Gibtarek&rsquo;s seas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the gulf of Venice too,<br />
With its shoals and waters blue;<br />
Where the mermaid chants her hymn,<br />
Borne upon the billow&rsquo;s brim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forward stept Arnaldos bold,<br />
Thus he spake, as I am told:<br />
&ldquo;Teach me, sailor, I entreat,<br />
Yonder song that sounds so sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>But the sailor shook his head,<br />
Shook it thrice, and briefly said:<br />
&ldquo;Never will I teach the strain<br />
But to him who ploughs the main.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>YOUTH&rsquo;S SONG IN SPRING</h2>
<p>O, scarcely is Spring a time of pure bliss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He is wrong who full trust thereon layeth;<br />
From many it may<br />
Take sorrow away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But to many it trouble conveyeth.</p>
<p>O, when every thing is as joyous in Spring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As in heaven, that never is dreary;<br />
&rsquo;Tis a grievous case<br />
If one mournful must pace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cannot be also merry!</p>

19</span>THE NIGHTINGALE<br />
<i>Translated from the Danish</i></h2>
<p>In midnight&rsquo;s calm hour the Nightingale sings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of freedom, of love, and delight;<br />
Come, haste to the grove where melody rings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Philomel&rsquo;s notes that invite.<br />
A fowler attentively follows her there,<br />
Resolv&rsquo;d for his victim to spread out a snare:<br />
<i>Think</i>, <i>girls</i>, <i>of the Nightingale&rsquo;s
fate</i>, <i>and beware</i>!</p>
<p>In ambush his nets he carefully brings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Glad innocence feels no alarm;<br />
Unguarded her flight&mdash;&rsquo;midst danger she
wings&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And falls into sorrowful harm.<br />
<!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Alas! she is silent, and full of despair,<br />
He glides away quick with his treasure so rare:<br />
<i>Think</i>, <i>girls</i>, <i>of the Nightingale&rsquo;s
fate</i>, <i>and beware</i>!</p>
<p>A beautiful cage adorns his fair prize,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In hope that for him she will sing;<br />
But Freedom, that wafted her notes to the skies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bore Gladness away on its wing.<br />
Thus you, Philomela, resemble the fair,<br />
And we, we delight in the love that we share:<br />
<i>O</i>, <i>think of the Nightingale&rsquo;s fate</i>, <i>and
beware</i>!</p>
<h2>LINES</h2>
<p>Say from what mine took Love the yellow gold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To form those tresses? from what thorn-bush tore<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those roses sleek? and from what summit bore<br />
That stainless snow which seems no longer cold?</p>

21</span>MORNING SONG<br />
<i>Nu rinder Solen op</i></h2>
<p>From Eastern quarters now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun&rsquo;s up-wandering,<br />
His rays on the rock&rsquo;s brow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hill&rsquo;s side squandering.<br />
Be glad, my soul! and sing amidst thy pleasure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fly from the house of dust,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Up with thy thanks, and trust<br />
To heaven&rsquo;s azure!</p>
<p>O, countless as the grains<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of sand so tiny,<br />
Measureless as the main&rsquo;s<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep waters briny,<br />
God&rsquo;s mercy is, which He upon me showereth.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each morning in my shell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A grace immeasurable<br />
To me down-poureth.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>Thou best dost understand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord God! my needing;<br />
And placed is in Thy hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My fortune&rsquo;s speeding,<br />
And Thou foresee&rsquo;st what is for me most fitting.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be still, then, O my soul!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To manage in the whole<br />
Thy God permitting.</p>
<p>May fruit the land array,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And corn for eating!<br />
May truth e&rsquo;er make its way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With justice meeting!<br />
Give thou to me my share with every other,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Till down my staff I lay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And from this world away<br />
Wend to another!</p>
<h2>FROM THE FRENCH</h2>
<p>This world by fools is occupied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And whom the sight of a fool displeases,<br />
Within his chamber himself should hide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And break his looking-glass to pieces.</p>

23</span>THE MORNING WALK</h2>
<p>To the beech grove with so sweet an air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It beckon&rsquo;d me.<br />
O, Earth! that never the cruel plough-share<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had furrow&rsquo;d thee!<br />
In their dark shelter the flowerets grew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bright to the eye,<br />
And smil&rsquo;d by my foot on the cloudlets blue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which deck&rsquo;d the sky.</p>
<p>To the wood through a field I took my way;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There I could see<br />
On the field an uppil&rsquo;d stone-heap lay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twixt hillocks three;<br />
<!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>So anciently grayly white it stood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An oblong ring:<br />
Here doubtless was held in the old time good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A royal Ting.</p>
<p>The royal stone, which there doth stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Stol-king press&rsquo;d,<br />
With crown on head, and sceptre in hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In sables drest.<br />
And every warrior solemnly pac&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Peaceful in thought,<br />
And down on his stone himself calmly plac&rsquo;d&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No sword he brought.</p>
<p>The king&rsquo;s house stood on yonder height,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With walls of power;<br />
On yon had his daughter, the damsel bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her maiden bower.<br />
Upon the third the temple stood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the North famed wide,<br />
Where to Thor was offered the he-goat&rsquo;s blood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In reeking tide.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>O, lovely field! and forest fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And meads grass-clad;<br />
Her bride-bed Freya every where<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enamelled had.<br />
The corn-flowers rose in azure band<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From earthly cell;<br />
Nought else could I do but stop and stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And greet them well.</p>
<p>Welcome on earth&rsquo;s green breast again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye flowerets dear!<br />
In spring how charming &rsquo;mid the grain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your heads ye rear.<br />
Like stars &rsquo;midst lightning&rsquo;s yellow ray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye shine red, blue:<br />
O, how your summer aspect gay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Delights my view.</p>
<p>O poet! poet! silence keep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God help thy case:<br />
Our owner holds us sadly cheap,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And scorns our race.<br />
<!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>Each time he sees, he calls us scum,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or worthless tares;<br />
Hell-weeds that but to vex him come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Midst his corn-ears.</p>
<p>The greatest grace done for our sake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In all his life,<br />
Is from his pocket deep to take<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His huge clasp knife;<br />
And heavy handful then to cut,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Midst grumbling much&mdash;<br />
Us with tobacco leaves to put<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In seal-skin pouch.</p>
<p>He says, he says, that smoked this way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We dross of the field,<br />
To the world by chance, by poor chance, may<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some benefit yield;<br />
But as for our beauty, our blue and red hues,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis folly indeed&mdash;<br />
The mouth is his only test of use,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s his creed.</p>

27</span>O wretched mortals!&mdash;O wretched man!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O wretched crowd!&mdash;<br />
No pleasures ye pluck&mdash;no pleasures ye plan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In life&rsquo;s lone road:&mdash;<br />
Whose eyes are blind to the glories great<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
